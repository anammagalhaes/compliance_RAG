    "This section presents the **business rationale**, **strategic justification**, and **solution proposal** for the **Dow Jones AI Compliance Copilot**—a tool designed to **add an intelligence layer** to compliance data that Dow Jones already licenses, processes, and delivers to B2B clients. By embedding these datasets into an RAG-powered Q&A interface, clients can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Receive instant, source-cited answers in natural language\n",
    "- Save dozens of weekly hours on due diligence\n",
    "- Reduce the risk of missing critical insights\n",
    "- Make faster, more accurate decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "Financially, this intelligence layer can **significantly increase the perceived value** of licensed data, unlocking new upsell and recurring revenue opportunities."

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Why B2B Compliance First?\n",
    "- The **Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)** market is valued at **$62.9 billion** in 2024 with a **13.2% CAGR** through 2030 [1].\n",
    "- The **RegTech** subsector grows from **$4.7 billion** in 2024 to **$29 billion** by 2034 at a **20% CAGR** [2].\n",
    "- B2B compliance solutions command **ARPU of $50K–$500K/year**, far above B2C offerings [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "Focusing initially on corporate compliance clients maximizes **ROI**, tapping a fast-growing market with buyers willing to invest in high-value solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Existing Dow Jones Offerings\n",
    "- **RiskFeeds**: Structured feeds (sanctions, PEPs, adverse media) in **XML, CSV, JSON** formats for screening and reporting [4].\n",
    "- **Integrity Check (with Xapien)**: Entity due diligence reports based on entity name and country, cutting analysis from **days to minutes** [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "**How the Copilot Differs**:\n",
    "- **Complementary** to RiskFeeds and Integrity Check, adding open-ended Q&A across all licensed data.\n",
    "- Returns **source-cited answers** instead of fixed reports or raw feeds.\n",
    "- Provides **ad hoc insights** to support immediate decision-making, beyond standard outputs."

    "### 4.1 Data Acquisition\n",
    "- **Production**: Clients continue to license **proprietary Dow Jones data** (sanctions, PEPs, filings, adverse media) via XML/CSV/JSON and APIs.\n",
    "- **POC**: For this proof of concept, **publicly sourced documents** were extracted and processed from the internet to simulate the same data structure.\n",

    "1. Licensed Dow Jones datasets\n",
    "2. Ingestion & Parsing (PDF, CSV/XML, HTML)\n",

    "4. Agent AI + LLM (semantic search + generation)\n",
    "5. Source-cited answers in Q&A interface\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Key POC Components\n",
    "- **RAG**: Combines vector search with LLM for grounded responses.\n",
    "- **Prompt Engineering**: Domain-specific prompt tuning.\n",
    "- **Model Flexibility**: Support for GPT-4, Claude, and on-premise Ollama models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 README & Usage Instructions\n",
    "The **README** in the repository guides:\n",
    "- **Installation & Setup**: Virtual environment, dependencies, local models.\n",
    "- **Pipeline Execution**: Document download (`docs/fetch_data.py`), semantic index build (`src/build_index.py`), CLI Q&A (`main.py`, `backend.py`).\n",
    "- **Notebook Demo**: `compliance_demo_report.ipynb` walks through interactive tests with example questions and source-cited answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.5 Test Questionnaire\n",
    "Because local indexing was resource-intensive and only a small document set was indexed, the file **`compliance_suggestion_questions.md`** includes curated test questions referencing the indexed context. This accelerated testing by covering scenarios such as:\n",
    "- Entity mention lookups in sanctions and reports\n",
    "- Queries on recent regulatory recommendations\n",
    "- Verifications of company-risk alerts\n",
